Game Cellar is a start up idea for an e commerce web platform that allows users to sell, trade, and keep wishlists of retro video games.
There is built in user authentication, as well as a profile page where users can display information about themselves for their peers to view.
Future installments will include: bidding on games, a message board for users to communicate publicly and privately, and game veryfier.
The app is still in development but has great potential to be the next big e commerce site.
